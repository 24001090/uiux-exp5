## Aim:
The UX Design Experiment aims to address critical user experience issues in two real-world digital design contexts:

1. *Health & Wellness App Design*:
   The goal is to develop a comprehensive and user-friendly mobile application that motivates users to build healthier habits by integrating multiple health tracking features (exercise, sleep, water intake, etc.) and offering personalized recommendations. The app should reduce fragmentation and help users maintain consistency in their health routines.

2. *E-Commerce Website Redesign*:
   The goal is to modernize a cluttered and outdated e-commerce platform that users rely on for browsing and purchasing fashion, electronics, and daily essentials. The redesigned site should focus on improving product discovery, enhancing visual appeal, simplifying checkout flows, and creating a more intuitive shopping experience for users of all ages. Key priorities include faster navigation, clearer categorization, personalized recommendations, and a mobile-friendly interface to support seamless shopping.
